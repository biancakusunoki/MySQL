-- Analyzing the employees who will receive a raise or bonus.
#If salary < 50000 = 5% raises
#If salary > 50000 = 7% raises
#If department = Finance = 10% bonus instead of raises.

#To analyze it, we'll need the salary table AND the park_departaments so we can see the department id's and see which is equal to the finances departament.
#Then, since every employee has a departament ID we match it to the number used in the park_departament tables.
